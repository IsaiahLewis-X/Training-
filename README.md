## Crude Conversational AI

This repository now ships with `bot.py`, a tiny yet boisterous chatbot that leans into
irreverent humour, colourful language, and a stash of rotating facts. It analyses user
messages for broad topics (space, science, tech, art, motivation) and sprinkles in
sarcastic comebacks to keep the vibe lively.

### Running the bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

You'll be greeted by **GutterMuse**, the resident "philosopher who swears like a
sailor". Type messages and enjoy the conversational chaos. Say `bye` (or hit `Ctrl+C`)
when you're done.
