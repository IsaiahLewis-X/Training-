# Friendly AI Assistant Demo

A small, responsive chat interface that simulates a helpful AI assistant named **Lumi**.
The assistant reacts to common conversational cues and keeps the dialogue flowing with
encouraging messages.

## Getting started

1. Launch a development server (for example Python's built-in server):

   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```

2. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to interact with the assistant.

The interface is mobile-friendly and automatically seeds the conversation to welcome users.
